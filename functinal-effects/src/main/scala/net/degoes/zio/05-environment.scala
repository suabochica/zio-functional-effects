/**
 * In ZIO, layers are values that contain construction logic for services in
 * your application. Services provide functionality like persistence or
 * logging or authentication, and they are used by business logic.
 *
 * A layer is a lot like a constructor, but may have complex initialization
 * or finalization, or may produce more than one service.
 *
 * ZIO has compile-time, type-safe wiring up of layers, which allows you to
 * optionally use ZIO for dependency-injection. The wire-up of layers
 * is done in a resource-safe, failure-aware way, with maximum parallelism
 * to decrease application startup time.
 *
 * Layers bring more power and compositionality to constructors. Although you
 * don't have to make your own layers to benefit from ZIO, layers can make
 * it easier and safer to assemble applications out of modules.
 *
 * Follow the patterns in Layers
 * - Use parallelism in interop tasks/dependency graph.
 * - Deallocate resources when you don't need it
 * - Solve the challenge of dependencies
 *
 * Layers are how you construct the things that go in the environment.
 *
 * The Layer as a way of structure the application Architecture
 * - ZLayer.Debug.tree will print a nice ASCII tree in the compiler output
 * - ZLayer.Debug.mermaid gives a link to the graph.
