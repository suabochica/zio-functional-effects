/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * In Functional Design, there are two ways to encode functional domain
 * constructors and operators:
 *
 * 1. Using a function or interface, whose methods execute the solution. This is
 *    called the "executable" encoding in this course. It's a direct, executable
 *    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain is modeled with a class
 *    or case class, or an open trait that is implemented by classes, then it's
 *    probably an executable encoding.
 *
 * 2. Using a pure data structure, which declaratively describes the solution, but
 *    which does not perform the solution. It's an abstract, "declarative"
 *    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain type is modeled with a
 *    sealed trait, then it's probably an abstract encoding, where the subtypes
 *    of the sealed trait model individual operations and constructors in the
 *    domain.
 *
 * In the second encoding, a so-called "executor" or "interpreter" or "compiler"
 * translates the data structure, which merely models a solution, into either
 * executable code or into another lower-level domain, which provides the
 * capabilities modeled by the functional domain.
 *
 * Executable encodings are "open" for new constructors and operators: anyone
 * can add new constructors and operators, without updating existing code. On
 * the other hand, executable encodings are not "introspectable": because they
 * are not data, but rather, opaque executable machinery, it is not possible to
 * add new ways to execute the models without rewriting all constructors and
 * operators.
 *
 * Declarative encodings are "closed" for new constructors and operators: no
 * one can add new constructors and operators, without updating existing code.
 * Yet, because they are pure data, it is easy to add new ways to execute the
 * models, for example, serializers, optimizers, converters, and so forth,
 * assuming their component parts have the same properties (not all
 * declarative encodings do; if you embed a function inside a declarative
 * encoding, it becomes opaque).
 *
 * Summarizing the difference between executable and abstract encodings:
 *
 *  - Executable encodings have unbounded constructors/operators, but a fixed
 *    number of ways to execute them.
 *  - Declarative encodings have fixed constructors/operators, but an unbounded
 *    number of ways to execute them.
 *
 * Note: Tagless-final is an executable encoding, but one where, by making the
 * "solutions" polymorphic, the choice of executor can be deferred arbitrarily.
 *
 * Legacy code prefers executable encodings; while many benefits of Functional
 * Design can be seen best using abstract encodings.
