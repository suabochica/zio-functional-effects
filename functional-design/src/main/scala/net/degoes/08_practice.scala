 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * In Functional Design, the most powerful approaches utilize typed
 * declarative encodings to model solutions to the domain problem, exposing a
 * composable, expressive, and orthogonal set of primitive constructors and
 * operators, upon which they add derived constructors and operators to bridge
 * gaps between the foundation and common problems in the domain.
 *
 * In this section, you'll tie together everything you've learned to develop
 * hands-on skills in applied functional design.
